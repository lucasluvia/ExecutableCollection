# ExecutableCollection
An all-in-one stop for my executable files for various projects, accompanied by text files for easy navigation.

This text file will help you navigate the folders here, accompanied with short descriptions of what to expect from each one.

10-Seconds
    A small game made for a game jam with the prompt 10 Seconds. 
    The game is a platformer where the player has to navigate between checkpoints to make it to the end.
    Every 10 seconds, indicated by an on-screen countdown, the non-checkpoint platforms will turn red and kill the player.
