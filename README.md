# ExecutableCollection
An all-in-one stop for my executable files for various projects, accompanied by text files for easy navigation.

This text file will help you navigate the folders here, accompanied with short descriptions of what to expect from each one.

10-Seconds
    A small game made for a game jam with the prompt 10 Seconds. 
    The game is a platformer where the player has to navigate between checkpoints to make it to the end.
    Every 10 seconds, indicated by an on-screen countdown, the non-checkpoint platforms will turn red and kill the player.

Data-Management
    A game jam project with the prompt "running out of space".
    The concept is you are collecting lost fragments and returning them to a console, along the way the player will find buff fragments that help them jump higher or world fragments that change features of the world, like making fragments magnetic.
    Only one buff of each can be applied at one time, in a more fleshed out concept the player would be required to choose the right one and change between them to complete different puzzles in the world.

Gravity-Stealth-Game
    A game where the player is sneaking through a drone-patrolled building and has to pass through rooms without being discovered.
    The player has a detection meter that fills when in view of a drone, and will be immediately caught if touching one.
    The player can control gravity and move across different walls, giving them better chance at getting by obstacles and climbing up tall walls to get to the next exit.
    
Hacking-Minigame
    A hacking minigame made to be part of a larger game.
    The player has to use provided characters to try to decode a passcode. There is difficulty and player skill stats that can be modified that change how hard the code will be to solve.
    More skill removes some options from the letter pool, while more difficulty makes the passcode longer and harder to solve.
    The game will only tell the player how many characters are correct or in the wrong spot, but not which they are, its up to the player to figure that out.

Mining-Tile-Minigame
    A mining/extracting minigame made to be part of a larger game.
    The player has limited attempts to uncover tiles so they can extract more resources.
    Each extraction diminishes the quality of adjacent tiles, so the goal is to reveal many high-value tiles before extracting.

Mobile-Plaformer
    As it sounds, this is a simple 2D mobile platformer. It uses an on screen joystick.
    Controls were not featured in the project, but they are left and right for movement, down to throw arcing projectiles, and up to jump.
    The game features enemies with projectiles, a life system, moving platforms that wait for the player before moving, a particle trail under the feet, and a win condition.

Results-Game
    A 2D puzzle-platformer with original artwork. 
    A level-based game where the player must traverse all levels without dying, each death sends you back to level 1 with the knowledge of what's to come.
    This game features the particle system, physics, moving platforms, and reflective platforms. There are also different states for the character that can interact and simple enemies.
    Such as, an electrified character jumps higher but will die if they get wet. A cold player can't jump as high and a wet player will freeze if passing through cold mist.
    There is a death counter that can be reset on the menu, but will otherwise continue to count up.

Simple-Pinball
    A very simple concept for a physics-based pinball machine with primitive assets.
    This project is more of a showcase of using Unity's physics engine to create a simple pinball machine.
